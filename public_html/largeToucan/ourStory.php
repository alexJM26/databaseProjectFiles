    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When our founder, John Aloyisous Bradbury, was a lad in the Ohio countryside, toucans were a thing of myth. That all changed when John found a single toucan in the woods, abandoned and alone. With his ever-large heart, John nursed the bird back to health. Overflowing with gratitude and with nowhere left to turn, the bird stayed with the Bradburys even after healing. Ray named his new friend “Large,” and they quickly became inseparable.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The years stretched by, with Large helping John to till the fields and feed the livestock in the day, and snuggling with him at night. All seemed well between the pair, until one day, Large fed the chickens to the pigs! Overcome with rage, John sobbed, “Why?! Why would you do this, Large?! Those chickens were our best hope of overcoming dry season, and you’ve killed them!” Breaking down, he looked through his tears to Large, who could only return a vacant stare.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;John tried his best to move past those terrible events, but an undeniable rift was forming between him and Large. John could never quite trust his friend like he used to, and Large was growing distant. Far from their old closeness, Large took to seeking out hidey-holes with his beak, secluded from the world.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One fateful day, Large chose the oven to roost in.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;John had no way of knowing. He hadn’t known, he <i>couldn’t</i> know, surely! Despite the rift, despite the loss of the chickens, he loved Large… didn't he? We can never be sure, and neither could Large. John turned the oven to 450, preheating it for that night’s dinner. By the time he heard Large’s screams of agony, it was too late. All that remained of his boyhood companion was the charred remains of its corpse, feathers flaking into ash, cooling flesh tinging the whole Bradbury homestead with an acrid scent.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;John mourned. And when the mourning was over, he moved on with his life. That day  was a tragedy that would color him forever, but he couldn’t let it define him. John learned, and lived, and discovered who he was without Large by his side. But sometimes, it seemed like Large never left.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It started with the scratching. Late one night, John awoke with a start. He’d heard a familiar sound--Large, trapped in some nook, was trying to escape. But that couldn’t be right. Large was gone. John scoured the whole house, but couldn’t find the source of the noise. Tired and nostalgic, he settled back into bed, certain the matter would be resolved in the morning.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the morning, the scratching sounded closer.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Shrugging it off, John continued about his daily business. And when night fell, the scratching was even closer. “John,” it seemed to whisper, “why would you trap me here? Why would you forget?” Night after night, week after week, the scratching inched closer to his bed. One day, John had had enough. He sold the Bradburys’ ancestral homestead, sleep-deprived and disturbed.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On his first night in the new home, the scratching started up again. Large’s spirit wouldn’t let him rest, wouldn’t let him move on. No matter how many times John packed up and moved, Large followed, his dying attempts at escape echoing throughout John’s psyche.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;John tried everything. He tried homes without ovens. He tried earplugs. He tried apologizing, begging the sound, “Please, Large, let me rest! I’m sorry for what happened between us. But your time has passed. Please, leave me be!” But the noise never abated, not for one night. John even tried destroying his home, lighting a match and whispering a prayer. All to no avail. For as long as John lived, he was torn apart by the specter of broken friendship--haunted by his mistake.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And that’s why he founded Large Toucan! To ensure every child had access to clean, fresh produce, and no family went hungry. Taking the lessons he learned on the Ohio countryside, he didn’t just create a store--he created a family. We honor John’s legacy by maintaining his values: treating customers with respect, sourcing locally, and selling only the best. At Large Toucan, we do what we love, surrounded by those we love. Welcome to the Large Toucan family.</p>
